## Here's a poem I wrote recently.
### Fri Feb 3 5:41PM 

The world is aflame,overwhelming, hot, unsteady.

Your feelings not lame,avid, intense, and ready.

This energy, this flickering,illuminates, informs, creates contrast.

Follow your light past bickering,for a source of energy that lasts.

The eruption is at the surface, epidermal.Center yourself, take deep breaths.Be Geothermal.

# Fri Feb 3: A Poem I Wrote Today. For when things get hard.

Martis,

The world is aflame, overwhelming, hot, unsteady.

Your feelings not lame, avid, intense, and ready.

This energy, this flickering, illuminates, informs, creates contrast.

Follow your light past bickering,for a source of energy that lasts.

The eruption is at the surface, epidermal. 
Center yourself, take deep breaths. 
Be Geothermal.
